00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:02.329
Thank you very much.

00:00:02.371 --> 00:00:06.371
Well, I would like
to start with testicles.

00:00:06.663 --> 00:00:08.288
(Laughter)

00:00:09.204 --> 00:00:11.954
Men who sleep five hours a night

00:00:11.954 --> 00:00:17.204
have significantly smaller testicles
than those who sleep seven hours or more.

00:00:17.246 --> 00:00:20.038
(Laughter)

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:25.163
In addition, men who routinely sleep
just four to five hours a night

00:00:25.163 --> 00:00:27.704
will have a level of testosterone

00:00:27.704 --> 00:00:31.038
which is that of someone
10 years their senior.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.829
So a lack of sleep
will age a man by a decade

00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:39.662
in terms of that critical
aspect of wellness.

00:00:41.954 --> 00:00:46.371
And we see equivalent impairments
in female reproductive health

00:00:46.371 --> 00:00:47.787
caused by a lack of sleep.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:53.746
This is the best news
that I have for you today.

00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:56.412
(Laughter)

00:00:56.454 --> 00:00:58.829
From this point, it may only get worse.

00:00:58.871 --> 00:01:01.621
Not only will I tell you
about the wonderfully good things

00:01:01.662 --> 00:01:03.496
that happen when you get sleep,

00:01:03.537 --> 00:01:07.996
but the alarmingly bad things
that happen when you don't get enough,

00:01:08.038 --> 00:01:10.538
both for your brain and for your body.

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.788
Let me start with the brain

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.829
and the functions of learning and memory,

00:01:16.871 --> 00:01:20.121
because what we've discovered
over the past 10 or so years

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:23.038
is that you need sleep after learning

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.371
to essentially hit the save button
on those new memories

00:01:26.371 --> 00:01:27.663
so that you don't forget.

00:01:28.954 --> 00:01:34.454
But recently, we discovered
that you also need sleep before learning

00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:37.538
to actually prepare your brain,

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:39.621
almost like a dry sponge

00:01:39.663 --> 00:01:42.121
ready to initially soak up
new information.

00:01:43.163 --> 00:01:46.288
And without sleep,
the memory circuits of the brain

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:49.079
essentially become
waterlogged, as it were,

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.246
and you can't absorb new memories.

00:01:52.163 --> 00:01:54.079
So let me show you the data.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.329
Here in this study, we decided
to test the hypothesis

00:01:58.371 --> 00:02:00.913
that pulling the all-nighter
was a good idea.

00:02:02.246 --> 00:02:04.579
So we took a group of individuals

00:02:04.621 --> 00:02:08.163
and we assigned them
to one of two experimental groups:

00:02:08.204 --> 00:02:11.663
a sleep group
and a sleep deprivation group.

00:02:11.663 --> 00:02:16.288
Now the sleep group, they're going to get
a full eight hours of slumber,

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:18.996
but the deprivation group,
we're going to keep them awake

00:02:18.996 --> 00:02:21.163
in the laboratory, under full supervision.

00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:26.038
There's no naps or caffeine, by the way,
so it's miserable for everyone involved.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:28.121
And then the next day,

00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:32.454
we're going to place those participants
inside an MRI scanner

00:02:32.454 --> 00:02:36.246
and we're going to have them
try and learn a whole list of new facts

00:02:36.288 --> 00:02:39.579
as we're taking snapshots
of brain activity.

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.579
And then we're going to test them

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.079
to see how effective
that learning has been.

00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:47.871
And that's what you're looking at
here on the vertical axis.

00:02:48.496 --> 00:02:51.204
And when you put
those two groups head to head,

00:02:51.204 --> 00:02:56.246
what you find is a quite significant,
40-percent deficit

00:02:56.288 --> 00:02:59.746
in the ability of the brain
to make new memories without sleep.

00:03:01.038 --> 00:03:02.871
I think this should be concerning,

00:03:02.913 --> 00:03:05.121
considering what we know
is happening to sleep

00:03:05.163 --> 00:03:07.579
in our education populations right now.

00:03:08.538 --> 00:03:10.371
In fact, to put that in context,

00:03:10.371 --> 00:03:13.871
it would be the difference
in a child acing an exam

00:03:13.913 --> 00:03:16.788
versus failing it miserably -- 40 percent.

00:03:18.288 --> 00:03:22.496
And we've gone on to discover
what goes wrong within your brain

00:03:22.496 --> 00:03:25.621
to produce these types
of learning disabilities.

00:03:26.746 --> 00:03:28.329
And there's a structure that sits

00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:32.996
on the left and the right side
of your brain, called the hippocampus.

00:03:32.996 --> 00:03:34.788
And you can think of the hippocampus

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.038
almost like the informational
inbox of your brain.

00:03:38.621 --> 00:03:41.829
It's very good at receiving
new memory files

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:43.329
and then holding on to them.

00:03:44.913 --> 00:03:46.621
And when you look at this structure

00:03:46.663 --> 00:03:49.704
in those people who'd had
a full night of sleep,

00:03:49.746 --> 00:03:53.288
we saw lots of healthy
learning-related activity.

00:03:54.621 --> 00:03:57.579
Yet in those people
who were sleep-deprived,

00:03:57.621 --> 00:04:01.246
we actually couldn't find
any significant signal whatsoever.

00:04:02.746 --> 00:04:07.704
So it's almost as though sleep deprivation
had shut down your memory inbox,

00:04:07.746 --> 00:04:10.704
and any new incoming files --
they were just being bounced.

00:04:11.913 --> 00:04:15.496
You couldn't effectively
commit new experiences to memory.

00:04:18.038 --> 00:04:22.538
So that's the bad that can happen
if I were to take sleep away from you,

00:04:22.579 --> 00:04:25.663
but let me just come back
to that control group for a second.

00:04:26.454 --> 00:04:29.788
Do you remember those folks
that got a full eight hours of sleep?

00:04:30.413 --> 00:04:32.871
Well, we can ask
a very different question:

00:04:32.913 --> 00:04:36.538
What is it about the physiological
quality of your sleep

00:04:36.538 --> 00:04:38.079
when you do get it

00:04:38.121 --> 00:04:41.913
that restores and enhances
your memory and learning ability

00:04:41.954 --> 00:04:43.079
each and every day?

00:04:43.996 --> 00:04:46.996
And by placing electrodes
all over the head,

00:04:46.996 --> 00:04:51.038
what we've discovered
is that there are big, powerful brainwaves

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:54.704
that happen during
the very deepest stages of sleep

00:04:54.704 --> 00:04:56.996
that have riding on top of them

00:04:57.038 --> 00:05:00.288
these spectacular bursts
of electrical activity

00:05:00.329 --> 00:05:02.079
that we call sleep spindles.

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:07.496
And it's the combined quality
of these deep-sleep brainwaves

00:05:07.496 --> 00:05:11.954
that acts like a file-transfer
mechanism at night,

00:05:11.996 --> 00:05:16.079
shifting memories from a short-term
vulnerable reservoir

00:05:16.079 --> 00:05:20.413
to a more permanent long-term
storage site within the brain,

00:05:20.454 --> 00:05:23.829
and therefore protecting them,
making them safe.

00:05:25.454 --> 00:05:27.496
And it is important that we understand

00:05:27.538 --> 00:05:32.579
what during sleep actually transacts
these memory benefits,

00:05:32.621 --> 00:05:36.746
because there are real medical
and societal implications.

00:05:36.788 --> 00:05:38.788
And let me just tell you about one area

00:05:38.788 --> 00:05:42.246
that we've moved this work
out into, clinically,

00:05:42.288 --> 00:05:45.496
which is the context of aging
and dementia.

00:05:46.871 --> 00:05:50.288
Because it's of course no secret
that, as we get older,

00:05:50.329 --> 00:05:53.579
our learning and memory abilities
begin to fade and decline.

00:05:55.038 --> 00:05:56.663
But what we've also discovered

00:05:56.704 --> 00:06:03.454
is that a physiological signature of aging
is that your sleep gets worse,

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:07.288
especially that deep quality of sleep
that I was just discussing.

00:06:08.621 --> 00:06:11.746
And only last year,
we finally published evidence

00:06:11.746 --> 00:06:14.704
that these two things,
they're not simply co-occurring,

00:06:14.746 --> 00:06:17.538
they are significantly interrelated.

00:06:18.829 --> 00:06:22.121
And it suggests
that the disruption of deep sleep

00:06:22.163 --> 00:06:24.454
is an underappreciated factor

00:06:24.454 --> 00:06:28.371
that is contributing
to cognitive decline or memory decline

00:06:28.413 --> 00:06:31.996
in aging, and most recently
we've discovered,

00:06:31.996 --> 00:06:34.204
in Alzheimer's disease as well.

00:06:36.329 --> 00:06:40.079
Now, I know this is remarkably
depressing news.

00:06:40.079 --> 00:06:42.371
It's in the mail. It's coming at you.

00:06:42.413 --> 00:06:44.704
But there's a potential
silver lining here.

00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:50.621
Unlike many of the other factors
that we know are associated with aging,

00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:54.288
for example changes
in the physical structure of the brain,

00:06:54.329 --> 00:06:57.371
that's fiendishly difficult to treat.

00:06:57.413 --> 00:07:01.954
But that sleep is a missing piece
in the explanatory puzzle

00:07:01.996 --> 00:07:04.579
of aging and Alzheimer's is exciting

00:07:04.621 --> 00:07:07.329
because we may be able
to do something about it.

00:07:08.538 --> 00:07:12.454
And one way that we are
approaching this at my sleep center

00:07:12.496 --> 00:07:15.496
is not by using
sleeping pills, by the way.

00:07:15.496 --> 00:07:20.454
Unfortunately, they are blunt instruments
that do not produce naturalistic sleep.

00:07:21.538 --> 00:07:24.788
Instead, we're actually developing
a method based on this.

00:07:24.788 --> 00:07:27.996
It's called direct current
brain stimulation.

00:07:28.038 --> 00:07:31.329
You insert a small amount
of voltage into the brain,

00:07:31.329 --> 00:07:33.579
so small you typically don't feel it,

00:07:33.621 --> 00:07:35.496
but it has a measurable impact.

00:07:36.829 --> 00:07:43.163
Now if you apply this stimulation
during sleep in young, healthy adults,

00:07:43.204 --> 00:07:47.913
as if you're sort of singing in time
with those deep-sleep brainwaves,

00:07:47.913 --> 00:07:52.454
not only can you amplify
the size of those deep-sleep brainwaves,

00:07:52.496 --> 00:07:57.038
but in doing so, we can almost
double the amount of memory benefit

00:07:57.079 --> 00:07:59.079
that you get from sleep.

00:07:59.121 --> 00:08:01.913
The question now
is whether we can translate

00:08:01.954 --> 00:08:06.246
this same affordable,
potentially portable piece of technology

00:08:06.288 --> 00:08:09.163
into older adults and those with dementia.

00:08:10.704 --> 00:08:15.288
Can we restore back
some healthy quality of deep sleep,

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:19.954
and in doing so, can we salvage
aspects of their learning

00:08:19.954 --> 00:08:21.454
and memory function?

00:08:21.496 --> 00:08:23.663
That is my real hope now.

00:08:24.371 --> 00:08:27.371
That's one of our moon-shot
goals, as it were.

00:08:29.329 --> 00:08:32.704
So that's an example
of sleep for your brain,

00:08:32.704 --> 00:08:35.912
but sleep is just
as essential for your body.

00:08:37.287 --> 00:08:40.954
We've already spoken about sleep loss
and your reproductive system.

00:08:41.871 --> 00:08:46.704
Or I could tell you about sleep loss
and your cardiovascular system,

00:08:46.746 --> 00:08:49.912
and that all it takes is one hour.

00:08:49.954 --> 00:08:55.454
Because there is a global experiment
performed on 1.6 billion people

00:08:55.454 --> 00:08:59.746
across 70 countries twice a year,

00:08:59.787 --> 00:09:01.662
and it's called daylight saving time.

00:09:02.912 --> 00:09:06.371
Now, in the spring,
when we lose one hour of sleep,

00:09:06.371 --> 00:09:11.996
we see a subsequent 24-percent increase
in heart attacks that following day.

00:09:14.954 --> 00:09:18.121
In the autumn,
when we gain an hour of sleep,

00:09:18.162 --> 00:09:21.996
we see a 21-percent
reduction in heart attacks.

00:09:23.746 --> 00:09:25.412
Isn't that incredible?

00:09:26.912 --> 00:09:32.621
And you see exactly the same profile
for car crashes, road traffic accidents,

00:09:32.621 --> 00:09:34.537
even suicide rates.

00:09:36.912 --> 00:09:39.829
But as a deeper dive,
I want to focus on this:

00:09:39.871 --> 00:09:42.329
sleep loss and your immune system.

00:09:43.162 --> 00:09:47.996
And here, I'll introduce these delightful
blue elements in the image.

00:09:47.996 --> 00:09:51.204
They are called natural killer cells,

00:09:51.204 --> 00:09:56.079
and you can think of natural killer cells
almost like the secret service agents

00:09:56.079 --> 00:09:57.704
of your immune system.

00:09:57.704 --> 00:10:02.704
They are very good at identifying
dangerous, unwanted elements

00:10:02.746 --> 00:10:04.121
and eliminating them.

00:10:05.246 --> 00:10:09.204
In fact, what they're doing here
is destroying a cancerous tumor mass.

00:10:10.579 --> 00:10:16.537
So what you wish for
is a virile set of these immune assassins

00:10:16.537 --> 00:10:18.579
at all times,

00:10:18.621 --> 00:10:22.412
and tragically, that's what you don't have
if you're not sleeping enough.

00:10:23.829 --> 00:10:25.454
So here in this experiment,

00:10:25.496 --> 00:10:29.329
you're not going to have your sleep
deprived for an entire night,

00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:32.871
you're simply going to have your sleep
restricted to four hours

00:10:32.871 --> 00:10:34.662
for one single night,

00:10:34.662 --> 00:10:37.662
and then we're going to look to see
what's the percent reduction

00:10:37.704 --> 00:10:39.704
in immune cell activity that you suffer.

00:10:40.787 --> 00:10:43.579
And it's not small -- it's not 10 percent,

00:10:43.621 --> 00:10:45.621
it's not 20 percent.

00:10:45.662 --> 00:10:50.204
There was a 70-percent drop
in natural killer cell activity.

00:10:51.787 --> 00:10:55.829
That's a concerning state
of immune deficiency,

00:10:57.371 --> 00:11:00.162
and you can perhaps understand
why we're now finding

00:11:00.204 --> 00:11:04.037
significant links between
short sleep duration

00:11:04.079 --> 00:11:07.996
and your risk for the development
of numerous forms of cancer.

00:11:09.871 --> 00:11:12.662
Currently, that list includes
cancer of the bowel,

00:11:12.704 --> 00:11:15.954
cancer of the prostate
and cancer of the breast.

00:11:17.829 --> 00:11:23.204
In fact, the link between a lack of sleep
and cancer is now so strong

00:11:23.246 --> 00:11:25.621
that the World Health Organization

00:11:25.621 --> 00:11:29.829
has classified any form
of nighttime shift work

00:11:29.829 --> 00:11:33.037
as a probable carcinogen,

00:11:33.037 --> 00:11:35.704
because of a disruption
of your sleep-wake rhythms.

00:11:37.829 --> 00:11:40.537
So you may have heard of that old maxim

00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:42.704
that you can sleep when you're dead.

00:11:42.704 --> 00:11:44.787
Well, I'm being quite serious now --

00:11:44.829 --> 00:11:47.412
it is mortally unwise advice.

00:11:48.371 --> 00:11:53.412
We know this from epidemiological studies
across millions of individuals.

00:11:53.412 --> 00:11:55.412
There's a simple truth:

00:11:55.454 --> 00:11:58.829
the shorter your sleep,
the shorter your life.

00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:02.412
Short sleep predicts all-cause mortality.

00:12:04.954 --> 00:12:09.121
And if increasing your risk
for the development of cancer

00:12:09.121 --> 00:12:11.371
or even Alzheimer's disease

00:12:11.412 --> 00:12:15.579
were not sufficiently disquieting,

00:12:15.579 --> 00:12:19.287
we have since discovered
that a lack of sleep will even erode

00:12:19.329 --> 00:12:23.412
the very fabric of biological life itself,

00:12:24.662 --> 00:12:26.662
your DNA genetic code.

00:12:28.037 --> 00:12:31.954
So here in this study,
they took a group of healthy adults

00:12:31.996 --> 00:12:35.746
and they limited them
to six hours of sleep a night

00:12:35.746 --> 00:12:37.412
for one week,

00:12:37.412 --> 00:12:41.246
and then they measured the change
in their gene activity profile

00:12:41.246 --> 00:12:43.704
relative to when those same individuals

00:12:43.704 --> 00:12:46.287
were getting a full eight hours
of sleep a night.

00:12:47.454 --> 00:12:49.246
And there were two critical findings.

00:12:50.204 --> 00:12:55.287
First, a sizable and significant 711 genes

00:12:55.287 --> 00:12:57.621
were distorted in their activity,

00:12:57.662 --> 00:12:59.079
caused by a lack of sleep.

00:12:59.912 --> 00:13:03.037
The second result
was that about half of those genes

00:13:03.079 --> 00:13:05.496
were actually increased in their activity.

00:13:05.829 --> 00:13:07.787
The other half were decreased.

00:13:08.454 --> 00:13:11.704
Now those genes that were switched off
by a lack of sleep

00:13:11.746 --> 00:13:15.246
were genes associated
with your immune system,

00:13:15.246 --> 00:13:18.121
so once again, you can see
that immune deficiency.

00:13:19.329 --> 00:13:22.412
In contrast, those genes
that were actually upregulated

00:13:22.454 --> 00:13:24.829
or increased by way of a lack of sleep,

00:13:24.829 --> 00:13:28.746
were genes associated
with the promotion of tumors,

00:13:28.746 --> 00:13:33.912
genes associated with long-term
chronic inflammation within the body,

00:13:33.954 --> 00:13:36.746
and genes associated with stress,

00:13:36.746 --> 00:13:39.787
and, as a consequence,
cardiovascular disease.

00:13:41.162 --> 00:13:44.829
There is simply no aspect of your wellness

00:13:44.871 --> 00:13:48.121
that can retreat at the sign
of sleep deprivation

00:13:48.162 --> 00:13:49.954
and get away unscathed.

00:13:50.912 --> 00:13:53.912
It's rather like a broken
water pipe in your home.

00:13:53.954 --> 00:13:57.579
Sleep loss will leak down
into every nook and cranny

00:13:57.621 --> 00:13:59.996
of your physiology,

00:14:00.037 --> 00:14:03.912
even tampering with
the very DNA nucleic alphabet

00:14:03.954 --> 00:14:06.787
that spells out
your daily health narrative.

00:14:09.871 --> 00:14:12.537
And at this point, you may be thinking,

00:14:12.579 --> 00:14:15.121
"Oh my goodness,
how do I start to get better sleep?

00:14:15.121 --> 00:14:17.371
What are you tips for good sleep?"

00:14:18.079 --> 00:14:22.537
Well, beyond avoiding
the damaging and harmful impact

00:14:22.579 --> 00:14:25.496
of alcohol and caffeine on sleep,

00:14:25.537 --> 00:14:27.954
and if you're struggling
with sleep at night,

00:14:27.996 --> 00:14:30.162
avoiding naps during the day,

00:14:30.204 --> 00:14:32.329
I have two pieces of advice for you.

00:14:33.079 --> 00:14:35.912
The first is regularity.

00:14:35.954 --> 00:14:39.329
Go to bed at the same time,
wake up at the same time,

00:14:39.371 --> 00:14:42.412
no matter whether
it's the weekday or the weekend.

00:14:42.454 --> 00:14:45.204
Regularity is king,

00:14:45.204 --> 00:14:47.162
and it will anchor your sleep

00:14:47.204 --> 00:14:50.496
and improve the quantity
and the quality of that sleep.

00:14:52.371 --> 00:14:55.037
The second is keep it cool.

00:14:56.079 --> 00:14:58.496
Your body needs to drop
its core temperature

00:14:58.537 --> 00:15:02.746
by about two to three degrees
Fahrenheit to initiate sleep

00:15:02.787 --> 00:15:04.871
and then to stay asleep,

00:15:04.871 --> 00:15:07.371
and it's the reason
you will always find it easier

00:15:07.412 --> 00:15:09.787
to fall asleep in a room that's too cold

00:15:09.787 --> 00:15:11.037
than too hot.

00:15:11.996 --> 00:15:15.537
So aim for a bedroom temperature
of around 65 degrees,

00:15:15.537 --> 00:15:17.496
or about 18 degrees Celsius.

00:15:17.537 --> 00:15:20.287
That's going to be optimal
for the sleep of most people.

00:15:22.454 --> 00:15:25.954
And then finally,
in taking a step back, then,

00:15:25.954 --> 00:15:29.162
what is the mission-critical
statement here?

00:15:30.787 --> 00:15:32.996
Well, I think it may be this:

00:15:32.996 --> 00:15:38.287
sleep, unfortunately,
is not an optional lifestyle luxury.

00:15:39.121 --> 00:15:43.662
Sleep is a nonnegotiable
biological necessity.

00:15:44.871 --> 00:15:48.496
It is your life-support system,

00:15:48.496 --> 00:15:53.121
and it is Mother Nature's
best effort yet at immortality.

00:15:54.704 --> 00:15:59.204
And the decimation of sleep
throughout industrialized nations

00:15:59.246 --> 00:16:04.454
is having a catastrophic impact
on our health, our wellness,

00:16:04.496 --> 00:16:07.162
even the safety and the education
of our children.

00:16:08.329 --> 00:16:11.329
It's a silent sleep loss epidemic,

00:16:11.371 --> 00:16:14.704
and it's fast becoming one of the greatest
public health challenges

00:16:14.746 --> 00:16:17.454
that we face in the 21st century.

00:16:20.287 --> 00:16:25.371
I believe it is now time for us
to reclaim our right

00:16:25.412 --> 00:16:26.871
to a full night of sleep,

00:16:27.996 --> 00:16:30.162
and without embarrassment

00:16:30.204 --> 00:16:33.579
or that unfortunate stigma of laziness.

00:16:34.621 --> 00:16:40.621
And in doing so, we can be reunited
with the most powerful elixir of life,

00:16:42.037 --> 00:16:44.746
the Swiss Army knife
of health, as it were.

00:16:46.662 --> 00:16:49.287
And with that soapbox rant over,

00:16:49.329 --> 00:16:51.412
I will simply say, good night, good luck,

00:16:51.454 --> 00:16:52.579
and above all ...

00:16:54.871 --> 00:16:56.662
I do hope you sleep well.

00:16:56.662 --> 00:16:58.037
Thank you very much indeed.

00:16:58.037 --> 00:17:02.579
(Applause)

00:17:02.621 --> 00:17:03.746
Thank you.

00:17:03.787 --> 00:17:06.621
(Applause)

00:17:06.663 --> 00:17:08.204
Thank you so much.

00:17:08.204 --> 00:17:10.954
David Biello: No, no, no.
Stay there for a second.

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:13.538
Good job not running away, though.
I appreciate that.

00:17:13.579 --> 00:17:14.829
So that was terrifying.

00:17:14.829 --> 00:17:17.913
Matt Walker: You're welcome.
DB: Yes, thank you, thank you.

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:23.496
Since we can't catch up on sleep,
what are we supposed to do?

00:17:23.496 --> 00:17:27.038
What do we do when we're, like,
tossing and turning in bed late at night

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:30.121
or doing shift work or whatever else?

00:17:30.163 --> 00:17:32.496
MW: So you're right,
we can't catch up on sleep.

00:17:32.538 --> 00:17:33.829
Sleep is not like the bank.

00:17:33.871 --> 00:17:35.913
You can't accumulate a debt

00:17:35.913 --> 00:17:38.621
and then hope to pay it off
at a later point in time.

00:17:38.663 --> 00:17:41.788
I should also note the reason
that it's so catastrophic

00:17:41.829 --> 00:17:44.871
and that our health
deteriorates so quickly,

00:17:44.913 --> 00:17:47.621
first, it's because human beings
are the only species

00:17:47.663 --> 00:17:50.121
that deliberately deprive
themselves of sleep

00:17:50.163 --> 00:17:52.538
for no apparent reason.

00:17:52.579 --> 00:17:53.704
DB: Because we're smart.

00:17:53.746 --> 00:17:58.579
MW: And I make that point
because it means that Mother Nature,

00:17:58.579 --> 00:18:00.288
throughout the course of evolution,

00:18:00.288 --> 00:18:04.621
has never had to face the challenge
of this thing called sleep deprivation.

00:18:05.288 --> 00:18:08.704
So she's never developed a safety net,

00:18:08.746 --> 00:18:10.871
and that's why when you undersleep,

00:18:10.871 --> 00:18:15.204
things just sort of implode so quickly,
both within the brain and the body.

00:18:15.246 --> 00:18:17.996
So you just have to prioritize.

00:18:18.038 --> 00:18:21.329
DB: OK, but tossing and turning in bed,

00:18:21.371 --> 00:18:22.788
what do I do?

00:18:22.788 --> 00:18:27.413
MW: So if you are staying in bed
awake for too long,

00:18:27.454 --> 00:18:30.704
you should get out of bed
and go to a different room

00:18:30.704 --> 00:18:32.038
and do something different.

00:18:32.038 --> 00:18:36.371
The reason is because your brain
will very quickly associate your bedroom

00:18:36.413 --> 00:18:38.704
with the place of wakefulness,

00:18:38.746 --> 00:18:41.413
and you need to break that association.

00:18:41.454 --> 00:18:44.329
So only return to bed when you are sleepy,

00:18:44.371 --> 00:18:47.913
and that way you will relearn
the association that you once had,

00:18:47.954 --> 00:18:50.454
which is your bed is the place of sleep.

00:18:50.454 --> 00:18:52.121
So the analogy would be,

00:18:52.163 --> 00:18:55.746
you'd never sit at the dinner table,
waiting to get hungry,

00:18:55.746 --> 00:18:58.704
so why would you lie in bed,
waiting to get sleepy?

00:18:59.538 --> 00:19:01.538
DB: Well, thank you for that wake-up call.

00:19:01.579 --> 00:19:02.746
Great job, Matt.

00:19:02.746 --> 00:19:04.954
MW: You're very welcome.
Thank you very much.
